\page examples Examples

\example examples/pdo.cpp
	
	This example runs a counter completely without SDO transfers.

	There must be a CiA 401 device which is configured to send 'Read input 8-bit/Digital Inputs 1-8'
	and 'Read input 8-bit/Digital Inputs 9-16' via TPDO1 and to receive 'Write output 8-bit/Digital Outputs 1-8' via RPDO1.

\example examples/core.cpp

	This example shows how to use the KaCanOpen Core library.

	It assumes that you have plugged in a CiA 401 device with node id 8, 16 digital outputs
	and 8 digital inputs.

	It starts the node via NMT, gets and sets values via SDO and determines
	device type and device name.

\example examples/listdevices.cpp

	This example lists all connected devices and prints their manufacturer device name.

\example examples/eds_library.cpp

	This example loads dictionaries from the EDS library.

\example examples/eds_reader.cpp

	This example reads an EDS file and prints the resulting dictionary.

\example examples/ros/ros.cpp

	This example shows how to use the ROS bridge which in this case subscribes and
	publishes topics to get and set digital input/output of a CiA 401 device.

	It requires that you have plugged in a CiA 401 device with 16 digital outputs
	and 8 digital inputs.

\example examples/ros/motor_and_io_bridge.cpp

	This example publishes and subscribes JointState messages for each connected CiA 402 device as well as
	uint8 messages for each connected digital IO device (CiA 401).
